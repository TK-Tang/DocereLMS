# LeaderboardLMS
Thesis project for my software engineering degree

It's an online learning management system where communities of students and teachers can socially interact.
While there are many learning management systems like Piazza, EDLMS, Canvas etc, LeaderboardLMS emphasises leaderboards and academic performance transparence.

Leaderboards rank students according to assessable materials which can be publicly viewed, giving all a broad and informative insight regarding
everyone's performance relative to each other.

Features including anonymity, chat, forums, and the ability for anyone to create and manage their own courses.

Inspired by Discord, LeaderboardLMS functions similarly on a rudimentary level with an emphasis on classroom environments instead of gaming communities
